# markdown.css
An elegant stylesheet for rendered Markdown contents

## Getting started
Markdown.css is a side project based on years of CSS development work on large web and app projects. Markdown.css only includes CSS styles for headings, paragraphs, text elements, lists, images, blockquote, tables, and code. 

There are 2 ways to get started with Markdown.css. You can either manually install or use NPM.

### Install manually

Download the compiled and minified [Markdown.css files](https://github.com/picturepan2/markdown.css). The `markdown.css` is located in `/dist`.

### Install with NPM 

`$ npm install spectre-markdown.css --save`

You will need to add the class `markdown-css` to the rendered Markdown content container.
